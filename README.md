The Village Areas Stamps Pack contains terrain stamps used by the Gaia stamping system to stamp features to your Unity terrains. 
Village Areas is a collection of 10 stamps of areas containing a mostly flat area in the center of the stamp which is ideal for 
the POI (Point of Interest) system within Gaia.

This pack is the first of many stamp packs planned for use with Gaia. If you have specific stamp types you are looking for, 
please visit our forums and post your suggestion for a new pack in our forum thread.

Pre-made Gaia session files!
Our pack's Gaia eXtension includes a foldout which allows you to playback the Gaia session which was created by 
Gaia when the stamps were tested. The session not only creates a new terrain and stamps it using the exact settings 
I used when testing the stamp and preparing for my screenshots, it also creates the same spawners and spawns exactly 
the same as seen in my screenshots! The spawners do require that you have the Gaia sampler assets which are bundled with 
Gaia to be installed. You can also load the session files into an existing Gaia spawn manager object and select to only 
run certain parts of the session, for example if you only wanted to stamp the session and then go use your own spawners. 

Asset version: 1.0.2
